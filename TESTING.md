# Real-device testing checklist

Things that could not be reproduced in a desktop browser and need a check on a real phone. Tick them off after trying them on the Android app (and, where noted, the web app in a phone browser).

## Open items

- [ ] **Nav badge stuck after "I have 5 minutes".**
  1. Open The Daily and tap "I have 5 minutes", then read or skip through the short list.
  2. Go back to the main lists.
  3. Check that the badge on the nav (the unread count) shows the real unread count, not the number from before.
  - Expected: the badge matches the number of unread stories.
  - Where: Android app and the web app on a phone.

- [ ] **"Why am I seeing this?" popover clipped near the screen edge.**
  1. On a story card near the right edge (and near the bottom), tap the small "i".
  2. Check the whole explanation is visible, with nothing cut off by the screen edge or the bottom bar.
  3. Try it on a card in the first column and the last column, in portrait and landscape.
  - Expected: the popover stays fully inside the screen.
  - Where: Android app and the web app on a phone.

## Added with recent changes (worth a look too)

- [ ] Tapping "Read on the original site" on a Subscriber Preview card opens a Chrome Custom Tab (Android app only).
- [ ] Sharing a link into CyPress shows "Read it now", and it opens the story in the reader.
- [ ] The Daily shows the right edition for the time of day (Morning from 5:00 AM, Evening from 5:00 PM) and ends with "You're all caught up".
